I never got to finish this project, AND YES IT IS UGLY AS SIN. 

SimpleScore was meant to be an easy to use golf scorecard app. The reason I started the project was to see if I could make an android application entirely with web languages, and to see how quickly it would run if I had the .apk go to the internet to run the app.

I ran into some snags that wouldn't allow me to have the app run the way I wanted, so I put a stop on the project. It still gave me a lot of insight on cross platform mobile web apps. If it had worked, I would have created an iOS counterpart for it. The mobile web design is anamorphic, so it worked with all sorts of screens and devices.

This is just here for anyone to take a look at the source if they want to attempt a mobile web app. 

NOTE: The android source is just a compilation of the files that matter. Everything else in the project is auto generated by Eclipse and the Android SDK.
